Dice Game!

 What this game is about? 

This code is a dice game where two players go head to head where they'll roll a dice to gain points. The goal is to reach a predetermined score first. I have included interactive features, test cases for key functions, and advanced functionality like a countdown timer for decisions and score tracking using Pandas. Over all, this just makes the game a bit more fun!



 The Features:
1: Roll Dice: Players roll three dice during their turn.  
2: Re-Roll Option: Players can re-roll non-matching dice within 10 seconds.
3: Automatic Turn Handling: Player turns are managed until someone wins by reaching the max score.  
4: Score Tracking:  
   - Player scores are tracked and displayed after each turn.  
   - At the end of the game, scores are presented in a neat table using Pandas.  
   - Statistics include the highest score and average score.



The Requirements
This program requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:  
- Pandas: For score tracking and statistics.  
   - Install Pandas with:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```



 How to Run the Program
1: Ensure Python and Pandas are installed on your system.  
2: Save the script as `ConsolidationFinalVersion_I&B_.py` (or any filename you choose to save as).  
3: Run the program using the terminal:  
   ```bash
   python dice_game.py
